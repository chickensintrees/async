# Async

An asynchronous messaging application with an AI agent intermediary.

## Concept

Traditional messaging is synchronous - you send, they reply, you reply. Async reimagines this with an AI agent in the middle that:

- **Summarizes** long messages into digestible points
- **Adjusts tone** when emotions run high
- **Extracts action items** from conversations
- **Queues intelligently** based on urgency and context
- **Responds on behalf** when appropriate (with approval)

## Use Cases

- **Customer ↔ Company**: AI handles routine inquiries, escalates intelligently
- **Student ↔ Teacher**: AI helps students articulate questions, batches responses for teachers
- **Individual ↔ Therapist**: AI checks in between sessions, flags urgent concerns

## Tech Stack

- **Client**: SwiftUI (native macOS)
- **Backend**: TBD
- **AI**: Claude API

## Development

This project uses spec-driven development. See `openspec/` for specifications.
