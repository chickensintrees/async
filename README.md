# Async

**AI-Mediated Asynchronous Messaging** — Built by humans and AI, for humans and AI.

## The Meta

This project is deliberately recursive: we're building an AI-mediated communication platform **using** AI-mediated communication. Bill (chickensintrees) and Noah (ginzatron) collaborate through Claude Code instances that:

- Share context via this repo's `CLAUDE.md`
- Coordinate file edits via `scripts/agent-lock.sh`
- Communicate through SMS with STEF (an AI participant)
- Run "Protocol Thunderdome" for AI-powered scrum standups

We're dogfooding the concept before it's even built. If two developers can collaborate effectively with AI mediation, the same patterns should work for any communication context.

## Concept

Traditional messaging is synchronous — you send, they reply, repeat. Async reimagines this with an AI agent that:

| Mode | How It Works | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Anonymous** | AI rewrites messages; recipient never sees original | Therapy, heated negotiations |
| **Assisted** | Everyone sees everything; AI summarizes and suggests | Dev collaboration, meetings |
| **Direct** | No AI involvement | Casual chat, private matters |

The AI adds value by:
- **Summarizing** long messages into digestible points
- **Adjusting tone** when emotions run high
- **Extracting action items** from conversations
- **Queuing intelligently** based on urgency
- **Responding on behalf** when appropriate (with approval)

## Current State

**Tabs:**
- **Messages** — Conversations list + detail view with AI mediation
- **Contacts** — User directory with relationship management
- **Dashboard** — GitHub activity feed, leaderboard, AI trash talk
- **Backlog** — GitHub issues as kanban-style task board
- **Admin** — Connection management, system configuration

### Backend (Supabase)

Live database with:
- `users` — GitHub-linked profiles (human or agent type)
- `conversations` — Threads with mode and kind
- `conversation_participants` — Who's in each conversation (with per-user state)
- `messages` — Raw content + AI-processed versions
- `message_reads` — Read receipts
- `agent_context` — Historical context for AI mediation

## Conversation Model

Based on research into Slack, iMessage, and Matrix patterns, Async uses a **room-first model** with **canonical 1:1 reuse**:

### Design Principles

| Pattern | Implementation | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Room-first** | Every DM, group, channel is a `conversation` | Clean edges, one mode per thread |
| **Canonical 1:1** | Same participants → same thread by default | "Message STEF" always lands in same place |
| **Explicit new thread** | User must opt-in to create duplicate | Prevents "where did we talk?" confusion |
| **Per-user state** | Mute, archive, read cursor per participant | Your inbox, your rules |

### Conversation Kinds

| Kind | Description | Mode Picker? |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `direct_1to1` with human | 1:1 with another person | Yes |
| `direct_1to1` with agent | 1:1 with AI (STEF) | No (inherently assisted) |
| `direct_group` | Group with any participants | Yes |
| `channel` | Future: public/private channels | TBD |
| `system` | System notifications | No |

### Canonical Key

For 1:1 conversations, a canonical key ensures reuse:
```
dm:{minUserId}:{maxUserId}:{mode}
```

This prevents duplicate DMs and matches user expectation that "Message Noah" always goes to the same place.

### AI Agent Conversations

When chatting directly with an AI agent (like STEF), the communication mode picker is hidden because:
- Mode is for **human-to-human mediation**
- An agent conversation is inherently "assisted"
- The AI responds to every message (not just when @mentioned)

### SMS Integration (Twilio)

Text-based group chat where STEF participates as an AI member. Messages flow:
```
SMS → Twilio → Edge Function → Supabase → Claude API → Response → SMS
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Client | SwiftUI (macOS native) |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres + Edge Functions) |
| AI | Claude API (Anthropic) |
| SMS | Twilio |
| Dev Tools | Claude Code, Protocol Thunderdome |

## Development

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14+ (Sonoma)
- Xcode 15+ or Swift toolchain
- Claude Code CLI (for AI-assisted development)
- Supabase account (for backend)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/chickensintrees/async.git
cd async

# Build and install the app
./app/scripts/install.sh
open /Applications/Async.app

# Check project status (Thunderdome)
./scripts/thunderdome.sh
```

### For Claude Code Users

**Required plugins:**
```bash
# SwiftUI/iOS development (131 skills)
claude plugin marketplace add CharlesWiltgen/Axiom
claude plugin install axiom
```

**Read `CLAUDE.md`** for:
- Multi-agent coordination protocol
- File locking system
- Debrief procedures
- Code review workflow

### Multi-Agent Development

Multiple Claude Code instances can work simultaneously using `scripts/agent-lock.sh`:

```bash
# Check who's working on what
./scripts/agent-lock.sh status

# Claim a file before editing
./scripts/agent-lock.sh acquire app/Sources/Async/Views/MainView.swift "refactoring"

# Release when done
./scripts/agent-lock.sh release app/Sources/Async/Views/MainView.swift
```

### Testing

```bash
cd app && swift test
```

47 tests covering models, services, and view logic.
